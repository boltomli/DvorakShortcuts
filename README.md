# DvorakShortcuts

## Background

I'm a balanced Windows/Mac OS X/Linux user. One day I switched from QWERTY to Dvorak keyboard layout. The transition went well, but as I make mistakes from time to time I wonder what would be the worst thing I'll encounter. Thus this repo.

Please suggest by raising issues if you have any idea how to show it.

As a start I listed a few examples here.

## Windows

Dvorak|QWERTY|Ctrl|Alt|Shift|Super |Common Effect|Common Mitigation|Risk
------|------|----|---|-----|------|-------------|-----------------|----
A|A|-|-|-|-|Same|-|None
O|S|Y|-|-|-|Save->Open|Cancel the Open attempt and go back to Save.|Medium
E|D|-|-|-|Y|Show Desktop->Open Explorer|Close the Explorer window and show desktop again|Medium
U|F|-|Y|-|-|File menu->U menu or nothing (if there's no such an item)|Alt+F once or twice|Low
H|J|-|-|-|-|No common use|-|Low
T|K|Y|-|-|-|Search bar->New tab|New tab is almost the same as search in most modern web browsers|Meduim
N|L|-|-|-|Y|Lock screen->Nothing|Try do the right thing|Low
S|;|-|-|-|-|No common use|-|Low

## Mac

Dvorak|QWERTY|control|option|shift|command|Common Effect|Common Mitigation|Risk
------|------|-------|------|-----|-------|-------------|-----------------|----
,|W|-|-|-|Y|Want to close the window or tab but preference is opened|Close the preference window and try again.|Low


## TODO

Reversed effect might be worthy to list as well in case.

So far the most obvious pain is that ^C^V becomes so hard. That's another topic which frequent combinations become harder.
